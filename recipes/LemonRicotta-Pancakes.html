        Description

    <p>
        <en><strong>"If these pancakes were any lighter,</strong></en> they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the
        whites. Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of
        butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.""

    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>large egg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and
        vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2
        tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
        <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto
        skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2
        to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
    </ol>
